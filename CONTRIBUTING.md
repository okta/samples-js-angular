# Contributing to Okta Open Source Repos

## Style

### Git Commit Messages

We use a simplified form of [Atom's](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#git-commit-messages) commit convention.

  * Use the present tense ("Adds feature" not "Added feature")
  * Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
  * Add one feature per commit. If you have multiple features, have multiple commits.

#### Template

    <emoji> Short Description of Commit
    <BLANKLINE>
    More detailed description of commit
    <BLANKLINE>
    Resolves: <Jira # or Issue #>

#### Emoji Categories
Our categories include:
  * :seedling: `:seedling:` when creating a new feature
  * :bug: `:bug:` when fixing a bug
  * :white_check_mark: `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
  * :art: `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
  * :memo: `:memo:` when writing docs
  * :fire: `:fire:` when removing code or files
  * :package: `:package:` when pushing a new release
  * :arrow_up: `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies, or generating files
  * :arrow_down: `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies

If you do not see an exact emoji match, use the best matching emoji.

#### Example
    :memo: Updates CONTRIBUTING.md

    Updates Contributing.md with new emoji categories
    Updates Contributing.md with new template

## Running E2E Tests locally before commits

E2E Tests can be run against the Custom Login and Okta-Hosted Login servers

In addition to running npm install in the root of the project (to install the dev dependencies for testing), you will also need to install the dependencies of each sample app. This can be performed via the `npm install` command:

```bash
# At project root
npm install
```
To test both samples you will need the following configured in your developer org:

* [A SPA Application](/okta-hosted-login#prerequisites)
* A test user account with a known username and password. Note that the USERNAME should be of the form "username@email.com"

Once you have those resources setup, export their details as the following environment variables:

```bash
export ISSUER=https://{yourOktaDomain}.com/oauth2/default
export CLIENT_ID={yourAppClientId}
export USERNAME={userName}
export PASSWORD={password}
```

For Windows, please set the following environment variables:
- ISSUER
- CLIENT_ID
- USER_NAME
- PASSWORD

As an alternative you can provide the environment variables in a file named `testenv` in the root folder.

For example:

```
ISSUER=https://dev-12345.oktapreview.com/oauth2/default
CLIENT_ID=spaclient123
USERNAME=myuser@example.com
PASSWORD=mypassword
```

> **NOTE:** Windows has USERNAME as a built-in system variable, hence set the USER_NAME environment variable for testing.

Then run the E2E tests:

```bash
npm test
```

**NOTE:** If you want to execute individual tests such as `npm run test:okta-hosted-login`, you will need to update the environment by running the following node script:

```javascript
node scripts/setup-env.js
```

**NOTE:** If you want to test a different org or client app, you need to delete the configuration files `custom-login/src/app/.samples.config.ts` and `okta-hosted-login/src/app/.samples.config.ts`, and start from [first step](#running-e2e-tests-locally-before-commits)
