<h1 class="ui header">Custom Login Page with Sign In Widget</h1>
<div *ngIf="!isAuthenticated">
  <p>If youâ€˜re viewing this page then you have successfully started this Angular application.</p>
  <p>This example shows you how to use the
    <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-angular/tree/master">Okta Angular Library</a>
    and the
    <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget">Okta Sign-In Widget</a>
    to add the
    <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-auth-code-pkce">PKCE Flow</a>
    to your application.
    This combination is useful when you want to leverage the features of the Sign-In Widget, and the authentication helper components from the okta-angular module.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you have logged in you will be redirected through your authorization server (the issuer defined in config) to create a session for Single-Sign-On (SSO).
    After this you will be redirected back to the application with an ID Token and Access Token. The tokens will be stored in local storage for future use.
  </p>
  <button id="login-button" class="ui primary button" role="button" routerLink="/login">Login</button>
</div>

<div *ngIf="isAuthenticated && userName">
  <p>Welcome back, {{ userName }}!</p>
  <p>
    You have successfully authenticated against your Okta org, and have been redirected back to this application.  You now have an ID Token and access token in local storage.
    Visit the <a href="/profile">My Profile</a> page to take a look inside the ID Token.
  </p>
  <h3>Next Steps</h3>
  <p>Currently this application is a stand-alone front end application.  At this point you can use the access token to authenticate yourself against resource servers that you control.</p>
  <p>This sample is designed to work with one of our resource server examples.  To see access token authentication in action, please download one of these resource server examples:</p>
  <ul>
    <li *ngFor="let example of resourceServerExamples"><a href="{{example.url}}">{{example.label}}</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once you have downloaded and started the example resource server, you can visit the <a href="/messages">My Messages</a> page to see the authentication process in action.</p>
